    <h2>Impactstory achievements</h2>
    <div class="intro">
        <p>Achievements are a way of looking beyond the numbers to find stories that matter:
            stories the buzz your research is generating, the level of engagement with your work,
            your openness, and some lighthearted fun from time to time.

                <p class="def buzz" ng-show="badgeGroup.name=='buzz'">
                    <strong>Buzz</strong> is the volume of discussion (good and bad)
                    around your research. It's a good&mdash;if coarse&mdash;measure of online interest around
                    your work.

                <p class="def engagement" ng-show="badgeGroup.name=='engagement'">
                    <strong>Engagement</strong> is about <em>how</em> people are interacting with your
                        research online. What's the quality of the discussion, who is having it, and where?
                </p>
                <p class="def openness" ng-show="badgeGroup.name=='openness'">
                    <strong>Openness</strong> makes it easy for people to read and use
                    your research.
