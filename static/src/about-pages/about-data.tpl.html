        Impactstory uses ORCID to find and import your scholarly works.
        Are you missing publications on Impactstory? Here's how to fix it.
    </p>
    <div class="ways-to-fix-missing-publications">
        <h4>
            <strong>1.</strong>
            Get your publications into your ORCID</h4>
        <p>
            Since we import from ORCID, if your ORCID is missing articles then so are we.
            Visit your ORCID to make sure it's got all your work. If not,
            use their <em>Scopus</em> importer to remedy that situation:
            <img src="static/img/gif/orcid-import-scopus.gif" width="400">
        </p>

        <h4>
            <strong>2.</strong>
            Ensure your works are Public on ORCID
        </h4>
        <p>
            Once you've got all your publications on your ORCID, we need to make sure
            Impactstory can see them. To do that, make sure their privacy is set to Public.
            If not, it's easy to fix:
            <img src="static/img/gif/orcid-set-public.gif" width="400">
        </p>
        <h4>
            <strong>3.</strong>
            Re-sync Impactstory ORCID
        </h4>
        <p>
           If you've made any changes to your ORCID, they'll get synced over to Impactstory
            automatically within 24 hours. Or if you're feeling like some instant gratification,
            you can sync manually from your Settings page: just click the
            <i class="fa fa-gear"></i> icon at the top right of the page, then
            click "Sync with my ORCID now."
        </p>
        <!--
        <h4><i class="fa fa-check"></i>Get DOIs for your remaining works</h4>
        <p>
            Some small publishers don't assign DOIs. Neither do YouTube, SlideShare, or
            other mainstream content hosts. You can't fix this for the original versions.

            But you can archive your publications
            in a <em>repository</em> to get a DOI for the new, persistently-archived version. Then you can import the new DOI into
            ORCID and Impactstory as normal. Here's an article detailing how:
            <a href="http://blog.impactstory.org/impact-challenge-dois/">
                Archive your articles, slides, datasets, and more.
